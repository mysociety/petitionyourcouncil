Petition Your Council
=====================

This site is now defunct. mySociety built http://www.petitionyourcouncil.com
in order to provide an easy way to see if your local council had an
e-petitions feature and provide a link to it. The site ran on Django and this
repo is the code that used to run it.

If you're interested in the data we collected to make this possible, please
see `councils.csv` in this directory. Contact us at hello@mysociety.org if you
have an interesting use for this that you'd like to discuss or you'd like any
help re-using this. (Warning, it's a bit old and somewhat unloved.)
