<h1>Privacy, cookies, and third party services</h1>

<p><strong>Our use of your data, cookies, and external services: what you should know, and how to opt out if you want to.</strong></p>

<p>Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below, and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites, but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full. If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins.

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do this. We use this information to, for example, to measure how people use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list the cookies and services that this site can use.

<table>

<h3>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better. Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same.

<p>If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you can install the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">official browser plugin for blocking Google Analytics</a>.

<p>The cookies set by Google Analytics are as follows:

<table>
<tr align="left"><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Typical Content</th><th scope="col">Expires</th></tr>
<tr align="left"><td>__utma</td><td>Unique anonymous visitor ID</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
<tr align="left"><td>__utmb</td><td>Unique anonymous session ID</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>
<tr align="left"><td>__utmz</td><td>Information on how the site was reached (e.g. direct or via a link/search/advertisement)</td><td>6 months</td></tr>
<tr align="left"><td>__utmx</td><td>Which variation of a page you are seeing if we are testing different versions to see which is best</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
